# **About Me**

Hi I am **Blanca Asensio** :wave:,<br>
I am a person eager to face new challenges every day and in search of continuous learning. I always try to adapt to the needs of the projects regardless of the role I have to acquire.

I have been working for five years in the software development world but the last four years have been more as a Backend Developer, developing all kinds of functionalities in microservices architectures with JVM languages (Kotlin, Java),
My goal beyond the technology stack is to always bring value to the product to be developed, relying on best coding practices. Simple code but looking for the highest quality.

I like to work in team trying to contribute as much as possible to my colleagues and at the same time trying to learn as much as possible from them, personally and professionally.
